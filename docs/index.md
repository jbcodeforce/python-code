# Python Studies

This repository regroup Python codes and notes from my own self-training and studies for web app development, crawling, Data AI, and even with [raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) work.

## Language Advantages / disadvantages

**Advantages:**

* Interpreted with shell to start quickly, more concise language
* May be now the 1st most used programming language
* A lot of libraries, used a lot by data scientists
* Combines functional and Object Oriented Programming.
* Raspberry PI language of choice
* Even new libraries are done to implement server side user interface, with project like Streamlit, [gradio.app](https://www.gradio.app/docs/), [Nice gui](https://nicegui.io/); [taipy](taipy.io)

**Disadvantages:**

* Slow, not supporting well multi cpu / threading architecture
* Not great for mobile and 3D game programming

## Getting started

See this good [tutorial from Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming#tutorial)

Python is an interpreted Object Oriented & functional language. It organizes the code in modules.
Use blank to indent code block. The coding style is known as PEP8.

[3.12 Release Product documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/index.html)

Use virtual environment to avoid impacting operating system python own libraries.

```sh
# create one virtual env: it can be reused between a lot of project.
python -m venv .venv
# on windows
source .venv/Scripts/activate
# on Mac
source .venv/activate
```
